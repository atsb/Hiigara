Properties (Resources):
********************************************************************************************

The properties consist of a number, which is composed of the addition of
the following different values: 


ATTRIBUTES_ShellOfResources 2 
ATTRIBUTES_VelToMothership 4 
ATTRIBUTES_DontApplyFriction 8 
ATTRIBUTES_KillerCollDamage 16 
ATTRIBUTES_Anomaly 32 
ATTRIBUTES_HeadShotVelToMothership 512

ATTRIBUTES_Regrow 2048 


ATTRIBUTES_SMColorInvisible 4096 
ATTRIBUTES_SMColorYellow 8192 
ATTRIBUTES_SMColorGreen 12288 

More Properties:

1      Attempts to salvage the object result in the Salvage Corvette attaching, waiting for
       a short period of time (set by it's value), and then returning to the mothership without the object.
256    Neutral ship.  It shows up yellow on the mini map, won't attack you, and can't be salvaged.


Here are some examples: 

Shell of resources:

- this only works for the spherical distribution. This flag indicates
instead of a sphere, it should be a shell. 

Set properties of a resource sphere to 2 


Regrowing asteroids: 

- This is perhaps the most useful attribute, and allows you to create
resource pockets that regrow. 

Set properties to 2048 
Set propertiesParam to indicate regrowing rate from min 0 to max 7, e.g. 7 

Note that properties and propertiesParam can be set from within MissionMan. 

Note that some of these properties were designed for the single player
game, and may not work in multiplayer. 

Rotating Derelicts:

- Do you want your derelicts turning in space?

Set properties to 8
If you want y-axis rotation set the first propertiesParam to 1  (Example:  8,1,?)
If you want z-axis rotation set the second propertiesParam to 1 (Example:  8,?,1)
Set both to one for rotation along both y and z                 (Example:  8,1,1)

Haven't done much testing yet... The 1 may be a boolean value, or it might be a rate of
rotation.  Try higher values and see what happens!
