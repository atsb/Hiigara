# Hiigara
Hiigara is a port of Homeworld that focuses on accuracy to the original across many operating systems.

Hiigara is forked from Garden of Kadesh, a web assembly focused port.  Hiigara is heavily modified to be a desktop focused port.

Both ports originate from the original HomeworldSDL project that has since been abandoned.
