Homeworld.cfg includes a section for Homeworld SDL configuration options
labelled:

    [New HWSDL Options]

This section can have the following options and are shown with their default
value:

CollectResourcesAtEndOfMission    FALSE

    Once you have completed the objectives for a level, any remaining resources
    will automatically be harvested once you issue the hyperspace order to your
    fleet. However, harvesting will only occur if you have at least one
    harvester and have eliminated all offensive enemy vessels, otherwise the
    resources will be left behind when you leave/flee.

ShipsAlwaysUseOwnerColors    FALSE

    In the original game, captured ships retained the colour scheme of the
    player who originally built it. This adds a certain degree of competitiveness
    since a player's success at stealing his opponent's ships is visually
    apparent. However, it also makes battles more confusing to command when ships
    on opposing sides nevertheless have the same colour scheme. This option
    allows you to specify whether captured vessels should be repainted with their
    new owner's colour scheme.

TimeCompressionFactor    8

    You can speed the game up in order to travel across large maps quickly or
    when you are waiting for something to complete (build/research etc). The
    default value is the same as in Homeworld Cataclysm (8 times faster). You
    can toggle the game's speed with the '\' key.
