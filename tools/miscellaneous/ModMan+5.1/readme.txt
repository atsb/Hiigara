Modman 5.1

Heres the latest version of modman for you. This improves quite a 
lot over previous versions. Unfortunately I haven't been able to write 
atutorial for it yet (University work interfering again!) but if you have 
any problems E-mail me (use my hotmail address -
Tall_paulb@hotmail.com, not this one). Heres some of the new 
features:-

-Filetypes
        Modman now allows you to associate filetypes with several 
applications, so you can perform any number of operations on a file 
using a simple right-click sub-menu. You can set these options by 
pressing the 'options' button and selecting the 'File types' tabbed 
page.

-auto generate ignore list
        The ignore list is a list of files and folders that you want 
modman to ignore when moving mods around, deleting mods etc... 
You can now edit this list from the options page.

-Homeworld + cataclysm support. 
        You can now switch between homeworld and cataclysm with 
one mouse click and keep a seperate set of mods for each.

INSTALLATION

        unzip modman to a new folder (eg c:\modman) and run 
mmsetup to select which games you have and setb the paths 
accordingly.  Homeworld mods go in the homeworld directory, cat 
mods in the cataclysm directory
eg:

c:\modman\homeworld\mod1
c:\modman\homeworld\mod2
c:\modman\cataclysm\mod1
etc...

have fun!
