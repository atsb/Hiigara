4481,          32670195,     39,          It appears to be an imperial broadcast.,   4481
4482,          32688298,     132,         In order to stay clear of these outposts, our course will take us into a turbulent asteroid field and through the heart of a nebula.,        4482
4483,          32751230,     79,          The enemy Mothership appeared to be equipped with a powerful field generator.  ,     4483
4484,          32781181,     89,          This field deformed our quantum wavefront and prevented us from making a hyperspace jump.,         4484
4485,          32818918,     96,          We also observed that the enemy's hyperspace module has an identical power signature to our own.,  4485

4489,          32990882,     95,          While the Khar-Toba was able to limp to Kharak, this ship instead must have tried to hide here.,   4489
4490,          33032465,     66,          They soon resorted to preying on ships passing through the nebula.,    4490
4491,          33058563,     55,          In time the nebula became off limits to all shipping.  ,               4491

4513,          33646335,     37,          The Enemy must have been desperate.  ,     4513
4514,          33657716,     76,          The time we took to break up that attack has allowed them time to reinforce.,        4514

4543,          34872759,     131,         We've determined that the alien control field covers this area.  No capital ships should cross into this zone or we will lose them.,         4543
4544,          34932426,     121,         Our weapons are having minimal effect on the alien vessel but each strike causes a tiny fluctuation in the control field.,     4544
4545,          34982195,     69,          Direct all fire at the alien ship in an attempt to disable the field.,               4545

4890,          47507198,     79,          We hear nothing there.  Even the Kushan fear the Great Nebula.  No one returns.,     4890

4895,          47797062,     145,         Conflict is not our way.  We will bring your cause to the Galactic Council.  The Kushan rule the Empire but even they must answer to the council.,         4895

4900,          48124729,     124,         This barren world appeared to be salvation. Their true legacy forgotten, a new vision of destiny had grown out of captivity.,  4900

4902,          48263771,     146,         Our spies believe that the Bentusi have interfered.  They must not be allowed to bring this matter to the Council and gain support for the Exiles.,        4902
4903,          48358493,     202,         In the First Time, a terrible war brought with it the collapse of your ancient empire.  So vicious were your enemies that all would have been slaughtered were it not for the collective outcry for mercy.,        4903
4904,          48480919,     118,         In an effort to sooth relations, the conquerors spared the lives of the defeated.  All survivors were sent into exile.,        4904
4905,          48559965,     86,          None were permitted to follow or aid the fallen.  All memory of them was to be erased.,            4905

4909,          48731646,     144,         You have failed to keep the Exiles from penetrating the outer perimeter.  This could be disastrous.  You will find and destroy them immediately.,          4909
4910,          48837022,     179,         A single artifact survived the journey.  The Guidestone you now carry.  It was removed from the sacred "Angel Moon" of your Homeworld, a place long since reduced to myth and tale.,   4910
4911,          48963745,     118,         Your progress is becoming known among the Inner Rim worlds and elsewhere.  Many cultures have prophesized your return.,        4911

4914,          49137694,     79,          All that moves is easily heard in the void.  We will listen for you.  Farewell.,     4914
4915,          49196061,     143,         You will fail.  The evil that drove us here will find and destroy you.  From you they will know of us and come here.  This cannot come to pass.,           4915
4916,          49305660,     152,         The Turanic Raiders who came before you refused to join and were punished for this trespass. Like theirs, your ship has already defiled this holy place.,  4916
4917,          49396548,     161,         If you have come to join we welcome you and will spare your ship until all have disembarked.  If you have come to consume the garden you will be removed at once.,       4917
