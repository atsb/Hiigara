<b><font size=+1>Encoding WAVs</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">

Homeworld is restricted to using 384 block bitrate because of the aforementioned hardcoded 
dependency on 384 for many of the phrases in the exe.  In order to avoid crashes, this program
is limited to 384 for homeworld.  Cataclysm (when support is included) will be limited to 512.

<p>
For each wav file, an encoding window will popup, one at a time. The program may seem to be locked up
but it is because of the blocking nature of the DOS call and the huge CPU usage by the encoder.  Depending
on the number of files and size of the files, it may take a LONG time.  I would suggest running this part
overnight.  Yes, encoding large numbers of files at a low bitrate of 384 is slow, even my 1.2ghz Athlon
can take a few hours.  It could be less, depending on your files. NOTE: One of the early testers mentioned
that Win98 had a memory leak and crashed after several hundred dos windows popped up and closed during this
part.  They had to build a DOS batch file to do the encoding.  My WinXP never had this problem.

<p> 
Also, you should make sure your wav source directory is in a short directory name with no spaces.  I
suggest something like C:\VCEWAVS or something like that.  The enc.exe file won't like spaces or long names.
This is a DOS drawback.  It won't even let you know that it didn't like it.

<p> 
When encoding is over, you should have the same filenames, but with .aifr extensions, in the aifr destination
directory, including a file called encfiles.log which lists the destination files and paths for later use.
