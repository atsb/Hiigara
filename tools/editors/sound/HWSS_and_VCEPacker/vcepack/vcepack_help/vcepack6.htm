<b><font size=+1>Packing the VCE</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">

Now, click on the VCE Pack tab on the top to change views.  The encfiles.log file should be listed in the 
Encoded File List field, in the directory where the aifrs went.  Also, the lengths.dat file should be there
as well.

<p>
VERY IMPORTANT:  You must re-run RESTORE.BAT file in the installation directory before each packing.  Failing
to do so will probably make bad LUT files.   I will automate this in a future version.

<p>
Just set the path for the output VCE file, and set the directory on the left side with all of the subtitle 
text files in it.  If you check the Strict Subtitles option, it will warn you if you don't have a subtitle 
for one that had a subtitle in the original and will also warn you if you have one for one that didn't
originally.  I would suggest you leave this unchecked unless you are completely changing all 11292 sentences.

<p>
Currently, there is a slider under the bitrate field.  Moving this will change the bitrate listed in the lut.  DO
NOT CHANGE THIS.  Leave it at 384.  It will be removed in a future version for safety's sake.  For Cataclysm,
it will be 512, but for homeworld, it must be 384.

<p>
This section will do many things:<br>
<li>It will make a new speechsentence_comp.lut file stating that all sentences use 384 bitrate<br>
<li>It will make a new VCE file with the phrases and subtitles and the associated speechphrase_comp.lut file<br>
<li>The speechphrase_comp.lut file will list the phrases in the vce that make up each sentence and the subtitle durations<br>

<p>
After this is over (and this is another thing that may take a couple of hours if you have lots of files, less time for 
fewer files), you will have the VCE file you specified in the field for the vce file.  Also, you will have two new LUT files
in the VCEPacker installation directory (I will move this to the vce directory in a future version).

<p> Now, you need to make a directory called soundfx under the main homeworld game directory and copy the two lut files into this.
You must now rename or delete the old HW_Comp.VCE file in the main homeworld game directory and put this new vce into the main
homeworld game directory with that name.  Also, your homeworld game must have been originally installed with speech on the harddrive.

<p> Start the game and try it out.
