Known bugs (as of 2004-08-01):

- Software renderer currently does not render 3D graphics properly (looks like
  it's not rendering any 3D for the most part, with triangles popping at
  various times).

- Various warnings (i.e. MEX files not found) are given during level loading
  (single player game or training mission).  This actually happens in the
  original Windows version, too, so it's nothing to worry about.

- Saved games are not compatible between the original Windows version of
  Homeworld and the SDL/Linux port of Homeworld.  Essentially, saved games
  created using the original Homeworld code are inherently non-portable due to
  the method used to save level state information.  Steps have been made to
  attempt to avoid any compatibility issues with this and future releases of
  Homeworld SDL across any platforms, compilers, or compiler flags used.  The
  game will no longer attempt to load saved games from the original Homeworld
  or from Homeworld SDL versions prior to 0.2.

- If you are currently running in OpenGL mode and you switch to software mode,
  you will be presented with a blank screen (not including a couple things
  drawn in the bottom left corner).  Basically, don't switch back to software
  once you have the OpenGL renderer selected.

- Certain systems configurations appear to be currently unable to switch to
  the OpenGL renderer.  This is being looked into.

- Rendering will cease to work properly from time to time when exiting the
  sensors manager.  In particular, this tends to happen when playing a
  skirmish against the CPU.  This may actually be fixed by now.
