Changes to ship creation
The only complicated one change I made was to the "Ships" directive.  It is also the only change which will be a per-ship attribute in the mission editor.  Here I added a new option string at the end of the line.  You can add a "colorScheme(n)" to explicitly control what color scheme the ship will be.  Here are the default color schemes for the ships as they stand now.  Let me know if you have a problem with any of these
Race		Default color scheme
R1		0
R2		1
P1		4
P2		5
P3		6
Traders		7

the 'n' in the color scheme should be between 0 and 7, inclusive.

Also, there are 3 optional strings at the end of "Ships" line.  They are:
colorScheme(n)
formation (such as PARADE_FORMATION or DELTA_FORMATION)
UseAsMothership

These strings can appear in any combination and should be separated by a pipe (|) with no spaces.

Here is an example of a Ships line using the new format:
Ships       Label,-3000,-5000,0,90,P1,P1MissileCorvette,5,DELTA_FORMATION|?|colorScheme(6)

Defining color schemes:
Color schemes can now be defined for a given level.  Color schemes defined in the level files will only last as long as that level; they will be reset at the start of the next level.  The player's chosen color will not be effected.
The format for changing the color scheme is a simplified version of that used in teamColors.script.  The only directives available are BaseColor and StripeColor.  The colors of engine trails and tactical overlay will be determined from these 2 members.

Determining what ships to load:
Not all ships/resources/derelicts etc. need be loaded for every level.  Substantial savings in loading time and texture RAM can be realized by excluding some things from the load.  By default everything is loaded every level.  If something is loaded in one level and not loaded the next, the space it occupied (in RAM and texture RAM) is freed for other uses.

Here is a listing of the new directives to control this:
ExcludeShips		race shiptype
IncludeShips		race shiptype
Exclude<Asteroids|DustCloud|GasCloud|Nebula> resourcetype
Include<Asteroids|DustCloud|GasCloud|Nebula> resourcetype
ExcludeDerelict derelicttype
IncludeDerelict derelicttype

The values of race are any of R1,R2,P1,P2,P3,Traders.  The value of shiptype would be any ship type valid for these races.  shiptype can also be "All" which will include or exclude that entire race.  Genocide so to speak!

The value of resourcetype depends on what type of resource it is.  For asteroids:
Asteroid0
Asteroid1
Asteroid2
Asteroid3
Asteroid4
HeadShotAsteroidR1
HeadShotAsteroidR2
For dust clouds:
DustCloud0
DustCloud1
DustCloud2
DustCloud3
For gas clouds:
GasCloud0
GasCloud1
For Nebulae:
Nebula0
For Derelicts, derelicttype is:
Fragment
Ghostship
Shipwreck
(more will likely be added later such as the scaffolding and perhaps other inanimate objects)

Determining what color schemes a ship can be:
By default, the color scheme of a ship is based on it's race.  See the table in the section "Changes to ship creation" for the defaults.  In order for your fancy color scheme to show up, you must enable it for every ship that will use it by using this directive:
AvailableColorSchemes	race type scheme#[scheme#[...]]
Race can be any valid race.  Type can be any ship valid for that race or "All".  The scheme number(s) are in the range of 0..7 inclusive.

Examples of new directives and changes:
Following is an example I am using to test these changes.

In the .level file I added:

; only load 1 pirate beyond the basic R1/R2 fleet
ExcludeShips    Traders,All
ExcludeShips    P3,All
ExcludeShips    P2,All
ExcludeShips    P1,All
IncludeShips    P1,P1MissileCorvette

; don't load the head shot asteroids, they're really big
ExcludeAsteroid HeadShotAsteroidR1
ExcludeAsteroid HeadShotAsteroidR2

; don't load all the derelicts
ExcludeDerelict Fragment
ExcludeDerelict ShipWreck

; black/red stripe color scheme for a 'stealth' missile destroyer
BaseColor                           7, 20, 0, 0
StripeColor                         7, 255, 100, 0

;regular R1 colors, R2 colors and 'stealth' colors
AvailableColorSchemes       R1 MissileDestroyer 0,1, 7
;pirates of a purple color
AvailableColorSchemes       P1 P1MissileCorvette 6

In the .missphere file I added:

;'stealth' missile destroyer
Ships       Label,-3000.0,-2500.0,0.0,-90.0,R1,MissileDestroyer,1,?|?|colorScheme(7)
;R2 colors missile destroyer
Ships       Label,-3500.0,-2500.0,0.0,-90.0,R1,MissileDestroyer,1,?|?|colorScheme(1)
;purple pirate corvettes
Ships       Label,-3000,-5000,0,90,P1,P1MissileCorvette,5,DELTA_FORMATION|?|colorScheme(6)

This made a mission sphere where I had 2 funky-colored missile destroyers and a formation of purple pirates.  Great fun for the whole family!

Nebula stuff:
********************************************************************************************
(Written by Keith Hentschel)

Nebulae use the same number of parameters as other resources, but with different intent.  Here's a template:

Resources Nebula, x, y, z, Nebula, [distname].dist, numTendrils, xSize, ySize, zSize, numChunks

x,y,z:               position in 3D
Nebula:              the distribution [normally cylinder, sphere, &c].  Nebulae can only be of distribution Nebula
[distname].dist:     relative distribution of RUs throughout the nebula
numTendrils:         the number of "tendrils" in the nebula
xSize, ySize, zSize: the extents of the region that the nebula appears within, defines an axis-aligned box
numChunks:           seed value.  best to leave at >= 60 * numTendrils, <= 100 * numTendrils

Nebulae aren't as flexible wrt controlling the distribution as other resource types because
of the extreme amount of randomness that goes into their construction: a vast cylindrical
region thinly populated with nebulosity tendrils appears mostly identical to a vast
rectangular region [box] populated similarly, and I found that too many constraints produce
unappealing tendril bunching.  Nebulae tend to form in a cylindrical / spherical fashion,
even given the box distribution.
