Next, click the SoundFX button on the left side of the window.  Once the view
on the right changes, click the aifr->aifrb tab at the top of the view window.
This is similar to the last window.  Just set the directory that has the 
newly created aifr files in the left side, which should list any aifr files
in the right side, and click the Convert button.
<br><br>
This will prep the general aifr file specifically for the BNK sound effects that
we are working on.  You'll again see some debug info at the bottom as each 
aifr is converted to an aifrb file.
<br><br>
[All this really does is strip most of the header of the aifr file out.  The 
important info on the sound is still in the log file which will be used later.]
