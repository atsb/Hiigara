Now, click the BNK Editor tab. In the top field, choose the BNK file that was 
copied to the working directory. The field on the left will list the entries, 
and if the sound entry description is known (listed in the sounds.dat file), 
it will apear next to the entry number.

[The sounds.dat file is currently not complete. Using Delphy's BNK extractor, 
along with winamp 2.x and the relic aifx plugin, one could identify more 
sounds that are located in each bnk file and add to the list.]
