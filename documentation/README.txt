Please feel free to add new documentation and correct existing ones. For reasons of cross-platform compatibility please create new documents as PLAIN TEXT (.txt). HTML (.html) is also fine should layout/highlighting be important.

PDFs (.pdf) are OK for sharing information but please be aware that most people do not have the ability to edit PDFs on their system and so are much less likely to be corrected.

Word documents (.doc) should not be used - other platforms that have some reading capability for these documents generally do not render them correctly, particularly embedded images.
