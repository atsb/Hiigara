The following tools are located in the "tools/win32" directory of the original Homeworld source code. (Relic's pre-compiled Windows versions of these tools live in "tools/bin".) A number of these tools are miscellaneous utilities that don't have any specific relevance to Homeworld, so the aim here is to work out what we need and, more importantly, what we don't... 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[A]lready imported into HomeworldSDL
[Y]es, this tool should be imported
[N]o, it should not be imported 
[?] not sure if this is useful or not

We need to convert [?]s to one of [Y] or [N] and [Y]s to [A]s. Then get the [A]s compiled and working.

(There may also be some bits and pieces in "tools/batch" that are of use but they mostly appear to be utilities for pulling together the files required for Relic's release candidates.)
