Homeworld SDL - Change log

* later releases (from February 2019 onward)
 - I don't want to maintain two changelogs, so please refer to
   https://gitlab.com/ThibaultLemaire/HomeworldSDL/-/releases

* 0.5 (2007-02-25)
 - So many improvements we've forgotten so e of them :)
 - Homeworld SDL now compiles under gcc 4!
 - clean up of the build configurations 
 - new/improved IDE projects on Windows and Linux 
 - Homeworld SDL playable on Windows (!) 
 - Missing derelict explosions.
 - converted Bink .avi movie playback
 - fixed: NIS sequences getting chopped up a bit. 
 - fixed: menu buttons missing text after a resolution change 
 - fixed: mouse cursor now aligns with movement disc when using resolutions with a widescreen aspect ratio 
 - fixed: saving of user preferences; more multiplayer settings remembered.
 - But derelict explosions are missing.

* 0.4 (2007-12-20)
 - The fabled lost release.

* 0.3 (2004-08-01):
Linux/x86:
- Enable sound and subtitles.  Audio is decoded using converted versions of
  the Windows .obj binaries provided by Relic.  SDL is used for audio output.
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Added fix for backing up register states in etgEffectCodeExecute() (ETG.c).
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)

Mac OS X:
- The game code changes required to support the MacOSX version of Homeworld.
  For the most part this consists of two things:
  1. Byte swapping (x86 use little endian data arrangement; PowerPC uses big
     endian).
  2. Temporarily turning off code because it is platform-specific or it has
     not yet been fixed to run on MacOSX yet and we just wanted to get
     something that compiles and, more importantly, plays. :)
  (OS X port by Michael Trepka <michael@machomeworld.com> and Tigital, with
  contributions by Laurence Passmore <lmop@machomeworld.com> and Martin Vito
  Cruz <sleepinghead@netzero.com>; code merged by Laurence Passmore)
- Add support for Command-Q "quit" keyboard shortcut.
  (Laurence Passmore <lmop@machomeworld.com>)
- Fix single player bug on MacOSX where the next level wouldn't load after
  hyper spacing because Bink movie playing is partially enabled.
  (Laurence Passmore <lmop@machomeworld.com>)

All:
- Fix bug 20: When loading a saved game, files are not looked for in the same
  directory they were saved.
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Sensors.c: Set smEyeStart = smLookEnd - smEyeEnd instead of smEyeEnd -
  smEyeEnd (=0).
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Fix buffer overrun bug that broke manual rotation of the Build Manager's
  ShipView.
  (Laurence Passmore <lmop@machomeworld.com>)
- Add auto-rotation of the Build Manager's ShipView.
  (Laurence Passmore <lmop@machomeworld.com>)
- Fixes some memset and variable assignment bugs in Camera.c.
  (Laurence Passmore <lmop@machomeworld.com>)
- Change all occurrences of abs() to ABS().  Also disables the FAST_TO_INT
  hack in src/rgl/fixed.h.
  (Martin Vito Cruz <sleepinghead@netzero.com>)
- Sensors.c: Enable the M key in the sensors screen.
  (Martin Vito Cruz <sleepinghead@netzero.com>)
- Fix the shortcut key issue somewhat more correctly by converting the hotkeys
  to lowercase, which is apparently what SDL is returning.
  (Aaron Plattner <plattner@caltech.edu>)
- Particle.c: Fix a segfault during mesh animation.
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Initial support for using $HOME/.homeworld for save games, screenshots,
  logs, and other such file output.
  (Ted Cipicchio <ted@thereisnospork.com>)
- Various compiler warning fixes.

* 0.2 (2003-11-23):
- Game no longer crashes during explosions (in the code, memcpy() was used
  where memmove() should have been used in etgCallbackOpen()
  (src/Game/ETG.c)).  This fix may also fix other unknown bugs and crashes in
  the game.
- Avoid using the same source and destination in strcpy() by passing a copy
  of lightCurrentLighting to lightParseHSF() in LoadLighting()
  (src/Game/SaveGame.c).
- Configuration settings will now load properly from
  ~/.homeworld/Homeworld.cfg
- Fixed a possible segmentation fault in fileSetPrependPath()
  (src/Game/File.c) from reading the length of a string within a dbgAssert(),
  which would not be compiled when HW_BUILD_FOR_DISTRIBUTION is defined.
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Resolution changes now work properly without needing to restart the game
  (menus, etc. now adjust properly).  Unfortunately, switching from OpenGL to
  software still causes graphics to be bunched up in the bottom left corner.
- The "/window" command-line flag now works.
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Converted the few C++ sources used (src/Game/KNITransform.cpp,
  src/SDL/avi.cpp, src/SDL/rinit.cpp) to C to eliminate the need to link to
  libstdc++.
- Relieve dependency on SDL 1.2.6 by removing references to SDL_LoadObject(),
  SDL_LoadFunction(), and SDL_UnloadObject() in src/rgl/kgl.c and
  src/SDL/sstglide.c.  While the code isn't as portable (uses functions
  specific to Windows and Unix-derivatives now), at least it should work with
  earlier versions of SDL 1.2.x.
- Modified save game code to be more portable.  Offsets to level state
  functions in memory are no longer saved in the save game file, as they are
  not portable across hardware platforms, operating systems, or compilers
  (including different compiler flags and possibly different versions of the
  same compiler).  Save games now use an index into a predefined array of all
  state functions, which is generated by kas2c.  The saved game version has
  also been changed (older saved game files will no longer be loaded).

---

* 0.1.1 (2003-10-11):
- Force ETG.c to compile without optimizations (was getting thrashed in
  optimization)

---

* 0.1 (2003-10-11):
- Initial release (no sound or network support, OpenGL rendering only)
