In this example, we only changed the ION cannon sound effect, but you can 
continue to change other sound entries in the bnk if you like.
<br><br>
After I finish my changes, I hit the save changes button to build a new guns.bnk file in the same,
working directory.  Two other files will be created: guns.bak and guns.bak2.
These aren't really important right now.
<br><br>
This process will make a copy of the bnk file, append the raw sound effects to
the end of it,and then update the header to reflect the new sound offset and
the new sound parameters.
<br><br>
Now, I can copy the new guns.bnk file back into the soundfx directory under
the homeworld game install directory and start the game.
