The soundfx directory that was saved using BigViewer3 should have the following
files listed.  In this example, we want to change the weapons sound effects,
so we copy the guns.bnk file to the directory where our wav/aifr/aifrb/log files
are located.
<br><br>
We will work on this copy until we are finished.
