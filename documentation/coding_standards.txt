----------------------------------------------------------------------
Coding standards that should be applied to the HWSDL codebase.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Homeworld SDL is and should remain C-compliant. No C++ classes etc please. The only exception is the use of the C++ single-line notation:

     // comment

which is allowed by all modern C compilers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Indentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each indentation increment should indent 4 spaces. No tab characters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bracing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It isn't always the case but the vast majority of the Homeworld source code uses vertically aligned bracing, so use the same for consistency:

    if (condition)
    {
        action;
    }

Although allowed by the C language definition and used in the code, do NOT use single statement if() notation. The above could be written:

    if (condition)
        action;

Don't. Brace it up to prevent confusion/bugs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
#defines
----------------------------------------------------------------------
#define constant names should be UPPERCASE.

Some common #defines to note:

PATH_MAX => buffer size for file path strings

<platform>_FIX_ME => #if'd to indicate that something is broken on <platform> which needs to be addressed at a later date

----------------------------------------------------------------------
variable/function naming
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All variable/function names should start with a lowercase letter. (Uppercase is indicative of Classes or #defines.) camelCaseNotation is used by a lot of code although underscore_word_separated is not uncommon either. Please use the predominant style used in the file you are editing.
