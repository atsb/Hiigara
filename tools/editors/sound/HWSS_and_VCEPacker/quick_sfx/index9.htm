Now, set the path to the aifrb file that will replace this sound effect.  Once
this is set, the attributes for this sound will populate the fields (which, before would
only show the attibutes for the sound already in this sound entry).
<br><br>
These attributes are derived from the log file.  They should be correct, so 
don't change them, else they will probably not playback correctly.  Some of 
the advanced features (like panning, volume, looping, etc) haven't been tested,
so it is good to leave them alone now).
<br><br>
Once you select the sound you want, <b><u>YOU MUST HIT THE SET BUTTON!</u></b>, if not, 
you'll lose this selection, when you select a new sound entry to change.  If you chose the wrong
one, or make a mistake, you can hit the cancel button, which will only revert to the original
sound effect for this sound entry only.
<br><br>
REPEAT, YOU MUST HIT THE SET BUTTON AFTER CHOOSING EACH SOUND ENTRY AND ITS NEW SOUND!
<br><br>
One of the problems of earlier versions of HWSS was that replacing certain long
sounds could cause a crash when pausing the game.  This was primarily due to the
looping of a sound.  The two biggest examples of a sound loop are the ion cannon
that is firing when the game is paused (the firing sound is looping within the
body of the raw sound), and another is the thrust sound which loops either in
paused or flight mode.
<br><br>
In order to loop a sound, a looping flag in the BNK header for that entry must
be set, and then two other fields (loopstart and loopstop) must be set.  These
are byte offsets into the raw sound.  Earlier versions of HWSS didn't handle these
and just copied over old loop values and flag settings.  In the case where the
new sound wasn't as big as the old sound, and the loopstart/loopend offsets extended
beyond this size, the game would crash to windows.
<br><br> 
HWSS v1.36 has looping turned off by default and you can't re-enable it.  This 
will be enabled in the next version.  Whatever is showing in the looping field 
won't be copied as long as the looping flag is shut off (and v1.36 won't let you
turn it on).
<br><br>
What happens now is, for the ION cannon, when firing and the game is paused, the 
new sound effect is played out, then stops making noise.  Until this looping is
fixed, it isn't a good idea to change the thrust sounds (which are in ships.bnk, I think).
