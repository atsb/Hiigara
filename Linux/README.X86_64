The code has been modified to run on X86_64 machines.
Due to the way the code had been written, the changes were 
tricky in places, and almost all of the binary files had to 
be modified due to including pointers within them as double 
word (32-bit integer) values which were then cast via the 
loadbase plus the stored value to a pointer. I don't know
if this is standard practice, but as the pointer size doubled
in 64-bit architecture the files needed to be adjusted.



Instructions:

If you're familiar with the normal procedure, it's the same 
except for the additional config switch and HomeworldSDL.big. 


Hopefully it should be 
1:  cd Linux        (Hopefully this directory)
2:  './bootstrap'
3:  '../configure --enable-x86_64'
        This should finish and include the -D_X86_64 flag
4:  'make'
5:  copy the homeworld binary found in src/ to the root of 
    your homeworld install directory.
6:  Make sure you have the latest HomeworldSDL.big in the
    same directory.
7:  run the game.




TODO:
Player 1 mothership MAD door launches don't work cleanly.
    I know where the code is, just don't have time to 
    wrap my head around where it's going wrong.
        This will get fixed eventually. hopefully.
**FIXED**

Movies:
    Might work. :) Not tested. 
    I need to re-do a lot of the cludged movie code anyway.
**POSSIBLY FIXED**

Network Play:
    Unsigned longs are different between x86 and x86_64
    Lots of work to do here.
    Azurief: I'll need your help! :)

Testing:
    Got to level 4, no real problems. You know where to put
    any problems for me to look into. 
    No promises on how long it'll take me though. :)
